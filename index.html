        <h3>Peace Prayer of St. Francis</h3>
            Lord, make me an instrument of your peace: <br>
            where there is hatred, let me sow love; <br>
            where there is injury, pardon; <br>
            where there is doubt, faith; <br>
            where there is despair, hope; <br>
            where there is darkness, light; <br>
            where there is sadness, joy. <br>
     <br>
            O divine Master, <br>
            grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, <br>
            to be understood as to understand, <br>
            to be loved as to love. <br>
            For it is in giving that we receive, <br>
            it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, <br>
            and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen. <br>
