            <p>
                Lord, make me an instrument of your peace: <br>
                where there is hatred, let me sow love; <br>
                where there is injury, pardon; <br>
                where there is doubt, faith; <br>
                where there is despair, hope; <br>
                where there is darkness, light; <br>
                where there is sadness, joy. <br>
                <br>
                O divine Master, <br>
                grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, <br>
                to be understood as to understand, <br>
                to be loved as to love. <br>
                For it is in giving that we receive, <br>
                it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, <br>
                and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen. <br>
