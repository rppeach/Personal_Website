    <div class="Ws">
        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>Just a man looking for a leg up in the world we find ourselves inevitably falling into</p>
        <h2>Where</h2>
        <p>Detroitish, MI</p>
        <h2>When</h2>
        <p>1997-Present</p>
        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>Wouldn't we all like to know</p>
        <h2>How</h2>
        <p>Still working on it
            <br>
            Currently trying to take my 20's to build a respectable skillset to take into the rest of my life. My hope is that a background in marketing, manufacturing, and psychology with a familiarity in tech will enable me to provide value in the world. After that, I hope to rehumanize the world.

        <h3>Some other thoughts and stuff</h3>
        <p>
            I wish I thought of other people more, but in the end I mainly care about me and my family.

            <h4>At last, a bit of my poetry</h4>

                This once I think, I thought I knew
                <br>
                But then with time along came you
                <br>
                Then I knew at last, I'm fooled
                <br>
                This world's forgot
                <br>
                What once, it knew
            </p>
