            <h1>RICHARD PATRICK PEACH</h1>
            <h3>That's Who</h3>
            <h2>What</h2>
            <p>
                Just a man looking for a leg up in the world we find ourselves inevitably falling into
            </p>
            <h2>Where</h2>
            <p>
                Detroitish, MI
            </p>
            <h2>When</h2>
            <p>
                1997-Present
            </p>
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>
                Wouldn't we all like to know
            </p>
            <h2>How</h2>
            <p>Still working on it...
                <br>
                Currently trying to take my 20's to build a respectable skillset to take into the rest of my life. My hope is that a background in marketing, manufacturing, and psychology with a familiarity in tech will enable me to provide value in the world. After that, I hope to rehumanize the world.
            </p>
            <h3>Some other thoughts and stuff</h3>
            <p>
                I wish I thought of other people more, but in the end I mainly care about me and my family.
                <br>

            <div class="poetry">
                <h4>At last, a bit of my poetry</h4>
                <p>
                    This once I think, I thought I knew
                    <br>
                    But then with time along came you
                    <br>
                    Then I knew at last, I'm fooled
                    <br>
                    This world's forgot
                    <br>
                    What once, it knew
                </p>
                ...
                <h4 style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    Another One!
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Life will be what we've loved and lost <br>
                    No more, no less, and that's the cost <br>
                    What's worse? To live with nothing to lose <br>
                    or to lose it all, this it what we chose <br>
                    To ignore the end, the inevitable collapse <br>
                    Again we see why we chase the past <br>
                    We are ancestors of times yet to come <br>
                    the present is that <br>
                    the sum of what's been done <br>
                    Yet here we are, waiting for the sun <br>
                    Clawing to make our mark on this server <br>
                    Living a life <br>
                    On God's great server <br>
